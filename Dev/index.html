                <h1>Early History of <span>Machine Learning</span></h1>
                <p>by Professor Karen Pine</p>
                <article>
                    <p>The first case of neural networks was in 1943, when neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts wrote a paper about neurons, and how they work. They decided to create a model of this using an electrical
                        circuit, and therefore the neural network was born.</p>
                    <p>Another extremely early instance of a neural network came in 1959, when Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff created two models of them at Stanford University. The first was called ADELINE, and it could detect binary patterns. For
                        example, in a stream of bits, it could predict what the next one would be. The next generation was called MADELINE, and it could eliminate echo on phone lines, so had a useful real world application. It is still in use today.

                <h3>1980s and 1990s</h3>
                <p>1982 was the year in which interest in neural networks started to pick up again, when John Hopfield suggested creating a network which had bidirectional lines, similar to how neurons actually work. Furthermore, in 1982, Japan
                    announced it was focusing on more advanced neural networks, which incentivised American funding into the area, and thus created more research in the area.</p>

                    <p>To be effective as both specialists and generalists - as well as being both practical and investigative - roboticists need a good set of supporting skills. In this list we've taken 25 career skills and grouped them into 10
                        essential skills for roboticists</p>
